# Newton Front End Challenge

Completed by Tristan Samuk

## Technologies and Rationale

- Builder: Vite
  - Why: Vite is much faster than `create-react-app`, and I like the built-in templates for React + TypeScript and the ability to run TSX directly without extra setup
- JavaScript Framework: React
  - Why: My prefered framework for its modularization and reusability capabilites, as well as being the framework I'm most comfortable with
- Languages: TypeScript, TSX/HTML, CSS
  - Why: I prefer to work with TypeScript when using React because it helps catch bugs and ensure props are correctly passed to components
- Runtime: Bun
  - Why: although there's still some compatability issues with certain Node modules, Bun is extremely fast, runs TSX directly, and has built-in hot reloads (no need for nodemon)
- CSS framework: Sass
  - Why: although CSS now has variables, Sass' mixins are still excellent for creating reusable styles.
